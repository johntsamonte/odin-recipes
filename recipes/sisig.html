        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Pork sisig is a popular Filipino dish. It can be considered as 
            a main dish or an appetizer. The composition of this dish is 
            mainly of pig’s parts such as minced pork meat, ears, and face. 
            Chicken liver, onions, and chili peppers are also added.

        <p>
            As mentioned, Sisig can also be enjoyed as a main dish and is 
            best eaten a cup of warm white rice on the side. Sisig is 
            synonymous to “pulutan”. It is a term used to describe food 
            pairings with beer or any alcohlic beverage. I like to pair it 
            with either beer or wine.
