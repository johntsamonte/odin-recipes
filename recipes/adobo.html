        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and 
            like all traditional dishes, there are many variations - including different proteins 
            like pork and beef.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fundamentally though, the key ingredients are the right 
            balance of soy sauce, vinegar, black pepper and sugar that create an 
            incredibly sticky glaze that has a depth of flavour like it's been slow
            cooked - but it's not!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>boneless skinless chicken thighs –</strong> cannot substitute with breast, need the fat to transform sauce into a glaze;</li>
            <li><strong>soy sauce –</strong> all purpose or light soy sauce. NOT dark soy sauce (bottle will be labelled as such if it’s dark soy sauce);</li>
            <li><strong>white vinegar –</strong> just everyday, plain white vinegar. Sub with any clear vinegar, including rice wine, apple cider, sherry vinegar;</li>
            <li><strong>onion and garlic;</strong></li>
            <li><strong>peppercorns –</strong> or coarse cracked pepper;</li>
            <li><strong>suger –</strong> brown best, white ok;</li>
            <li><strong>bay leaves –</strong> fresh or dried, not the end of the world if you don’t have;</li>
            <li><strong>green onion –</strong> optional garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned – about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
            <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice. Pictured in post as a healthy dinner plate (415 calories) with cauliflower rice and Ginger Smashed Cucumbers.</li>
